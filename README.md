# SnowScoop

A Web Scraping app written in Flutter/Dart. 

The goal of this application was to learn more about Flutter and to explore some new packages. 
Ideally I would write a Python scraper that gets called every hour or so and writes the data to a NoSQL db. Then just read JSON directly from the app. 

Instead I have been scraping on the device itself, which is not good for usability or load times, but it achieves what I need it to for a test application.
